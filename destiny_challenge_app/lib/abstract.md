### Data abstraction in dart

	In class methods , the funcs whose name starts without _ (underscore) will be accessible to outside of class
	
	Eg: 
		
		void _multiply(int a, int b) {} - this func is only accessible to other func inside the class to access, which means they are companion or assistive func
		
		void getElement(int choice){} - this func is accessible to outside than the class
